## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox


### What I learned

I have learned how to Google solutions for my coding problems. I have used Stack Overflow, W3 School, and some of my prior knowledge of basic HTML and CSS Media Queries to make it mobile-responsive. I also learned and implemented CSS variables. This project also reinforced some basic git commands. 


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.


### Useful resources

- [This README](README.md) - This helped me to understand why I need a README file and gave me an outline to use. 
- [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This recommended article is an informative introduction on Markdowns.
